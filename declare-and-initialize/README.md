# Zero Value Concept
Every single value I construct in Go is initialized at least to its zero value state unless I specify the initialization value at construction. The zero value is the setting of every bit in every byte to zero.

# Declare and Initialize
The keyword var can be used to construct values to their zero value state for all types.
Using the short variable declaration operator, I can declare, construct, and initialize a value all at the same time.
